Group project of 3 - a fun pokemon battle game where you attack opponents, buy stardust and hear some cool sound effects.

///// ATTENTION /////
Completed: April 2021 - done without any DOM manipulation training/knowledge.
Rendering the project on the browser was not art of the assignment, hence the code might be a bit rusty.
